- ✅ Coverage: >90% target

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- ✅ Automated testing on every push
- ✅ Coverage reporting
- ✅ Artifact uploads

### 5. **Documentation**
- ✅ Comprehensive README with examples
- ✅ QUICKSTART guide for fast reference
- ✅ Pre-commit checklist script
- ✅ Project structure documentation

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS - Follow This Sequence

### Step 1: Install Poetry (if not already installed)

```bash
# Install Poetry
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Add to PATH
export PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Add to ~/.bashrc for persistence
echo 'export PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Verify
poetry --version
```

### Step 2: Configure Poetry & Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /root/FastApiCalc_is218

# Configure in-project virtualenv
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

# Verify configuration
poetry config --list | grep virtualenvs.in-project

# Install all dependencies (THIS WILL TAKE A FEW MINUTES)
poetry install

# You should see installation progress for all packages
```

### Step 3: Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell

# Your prompt should now show (.venv)
# Verify Python path
which python
# Should output: /root/FastApiCalc_is218/.venv/bin/python

# Verify packages installed
poetry show
```

### Step 4: Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (required for E2E tests)
poetry run playwright install --with-deps

# This will download Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit
# May take a few minutes
```

### Step 5: Test the Application

```bash
# Run unit tests (should all pass)
poetry run pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run integration tests (should all pass)
poetry run pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Start server in one terminal
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# In another terminal (after activating venv), run E2E tests
poetry shell
poetry run pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

### Step 6: Run the Application Locally

```bash
# Option 1: Use the quick start script
./start.sh

# Option 2: Manual start
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Access the application:
# - Web UI: http://localhost:8000/
# - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
# - Health: http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Step 7: Verify Everything Works

```bash
# In browser, visit:
http://localhost:8000/

# Test the calculator UI:
# 1. Enter x=15, y=7
# 2. Select "Addition"
# 3. Click "Calculate"
# 4. Should show "Result: 22"

# Test API directly:
curl "http://localhost:8000/add?x=5&y=3"
# Should return: {"operation":"add","x":5.0,"y":3.0,"result":8.0}

# Test POST endpoint:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/calc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"operation":"multiply","x":6,"y":7}'
# Should return: {"operation":"multiply","x":6.0,"y":7.0,"result":42.0}
```

### Step 8: Run All Tests with Coverage

```bash
# Run complete test suite with coverage report
poetry run pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Open HTML coverage report
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html
# or manually open in browser: file:///root/FastApiCalc_is218/htmlcov/index.html
```

### Step 9: Git Workflow

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# First commit
git commit -m "feat: initial FastAPI calculator with SOLID design

- Implement Strategy pattern for operations
- Add comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Configure GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- Create web UI for calculator
- Add structured logging"

# Add remote (use your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/as4584/midterm.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 10: Take Screenshots for Submission

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
export PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

**Issue**: Port 8000 already in use
```bash
lsof -i :8000
kill -9 <PID>
# Or use different port: --port 8001
```

**Issue**: Playwright tests fail
```bash
poetry run playwright install --with-deps
```

**Issue**: Import errors
```bash
# Ensure conftest.py exists and venv is active
poetry shell
poetry install
```

**Issue**: Tests fail in CI but pass locally
```bash
# Check Python version matches (3.10 or 3.11)
python --version
# Ensure all dependencies in pyproject.toml
poetry show
```
